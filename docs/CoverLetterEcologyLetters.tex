\noindent Dear Dr. Thrall:
\vspace{1.5ex}\\
\noindent Please consider our paper, ``Current environments and evolutionary history shape forest temporal assembly'' for publication as a letter in \emph{Ecology Letters}. 
\vspace{1.5ex}\\ 
%emw17Dec: Sorry this took me a while, I started on the 16th but only had a few minutes here and there to work on it. I suggest we remove phenology as we have too many other terms and it does not help us and I tried to make it sound more like the paper and more exciting, as well as removing a lot of dense language and some phrasing I don't think we really meant.... If you feel good, you can submit without me looking again but as most offices have now closed for the holidays, if you want to wait I am happy to take one final read thru of this, 
% Ecological communities are shaped by environmental variability and species interactions across both time and space. 
Global shifts in the timings of species life history events with anthropogenic climate change has to led to increasing interest in how communities may assemble in time. Yet progress has been slow because species timings are variable across time and space, with inter-annual variability especially high in many systems where timings are changing the most. Experiments can remove much of this variability by decomposing it into predictable responses to environmental cues, such as temperature and daylength, but they are logistically challenging. As such they have generally focused on only a few species, and currently provide limited insights into community dynamics under future climates.

\noindent 
Here, we present a large-scale experiment, spanning four sites, 47 species and over XX individuals to test for evidence of temporal assembly.  We focus on leafout of forest trees and shrubs for which the environmental cues---temperature and photoperiod---are well studied and we directly test the role of populations, species and community-level variation in shaping leafout. To account for the effects of species evolutionary history, we paired our experimental data with a phylogenetic tree and Bayesian model to mechanistically test the relationships and variability in environmental cues and evolutionary relationships.

\noindent  
%emw17Dec: Can you add the biggest diff in latitude and also distance between the two sites across coasts?
We found species separated their timings in each site, supporting the idea that temporal assembly may structure communities. Further, we show that species timings can be robustly decomposed into stable responses to temperature and daylength, with responses surprisingly constant across populations, even those separated by XX \degree of latitude and XX \degree of longitude. These responses to environmental cues, however, explained little of the temporal variation across species. Differences in timings observed across species were also explained by intrinsic differences, which themselves were partially explained by evolutionary history. These findings suggest our understanding of one of the most well studied events---leafout---is still incomplete and that other unidentified traits or cues shape the temporal assembly of communities. 
\vspace{1.5ex}\\
Our study also presents a powerful analytical approach that has broad applications across diverse species assemblages. The phylogenetic model we use in our analysis could be applied to other types of life history events or suites of species, allowing us to test for differences between invasive and native species in a community or across species in distinct trophic-levels or functional groups.

%emw26Nov: For ELE we need to be less specific to phenology and forests ... see my edits to the abstract and try to edit the below to be more general. You might review some of Volker Rudolf's papers on temporal assembly for inspiration. I would focus broader and then tuck in a sentence about forest assembly and climate change versus leading with leafout phenology in any paragraph. 
\noindent All authors contributed to this work and approve this version for submission. The manuscript is 3773 words with a 150 word summary, and 3 figures. It is not under consideration elsewhere. We hope you find it suitable for publication in \emph{Ecology Letters}, and look forward to hearing from you.
