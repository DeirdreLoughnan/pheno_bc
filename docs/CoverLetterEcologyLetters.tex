\noindent Dear Dr. Thrall:
\vspace{1.5ex}\\
\noindent Please consider our paper, ``Current environments and evolutionary history shape forest temporal assembly'' for publication as a letter in \emph{Ecology Letters}. 
\vspace{1.5ex}\\ 
% Ecological communities are shaped by environmental variability and species interactions across both time and space. 
Global shifts in the timings of species life history events with anthropogenic climate change has to led to increasing interest in how communities assemble in time. Yet progress has been slow, as species timings are variable across time and space, and high inter-annual variability occurring in systems where shifts have been greatest. Using experiments, we can decompose this variability into predictable responses to environmental cues, like temperature and daylength. But given their logistic challenges, most experiments have focused on only a few species, and provide limited insights into community dynamics under future climates. % make shorter add 4-6 high impact citations

\noindent 
Here, we present a large-scale experiment, spanning four sites, 47 species and over 3450 individual cuttings to test for temporal assembly.  We focus on leafout of trees and shrubs for which the environmental cues---temperature and photoperiod---are well studied and directly test the variability at the population, species and community-level. To mechanistically test the relationships and variability in environmental cues and species evolutionary relationships, we paired our experimental data with a phylogenetic tree and Bayesian model

%emw17Dec: Can you add the biggest diff in latitude and also distance between the two sites across coasts?
We found species separated their timings in each site, supporting the idea that temporal assembly may structure communities. Further, we show that species timings can be robustly decomposed into stable responses to temperature and daylength, with responses surprisingly constant across populations, even those separated by 6\textdegree of latitude and 55\textdegree of longitude. These responses to environmental cues, however, explained little of the temporal variation across species. Differences in timings observed across species were also explained by intrinsic differences, which themselves were partially explained by evolutionary history. These findings suggest our understanding of one of the most well studied events---leafout---is still incomplete and that other unidentified traits or cues shape the temporal assembly of communities. 
\vspace{1.5ex}\\
Our study also presents a powerful analytical approach that has broad applications across diverse species assemblages. The phylogenetic model we use in our analysis could be applied to other types of life history events or suites of species, allowing us to test for differences between invasive and native species in a community or across species in distinct trophic-levels or functional groups.

%emw26Nov: For ELE we need to be less specific to phenology and forests ... see my edits to the abstract and try to edit the below to be more general. You might review some of Volker Rudolf's papers on temporal assembly for inspiration. I would focus broader and then tuck in a sentence about forest assembly and climate change versus leading with leafout phenology in any paragraph.
