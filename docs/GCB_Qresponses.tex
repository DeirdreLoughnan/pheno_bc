\textbf{Question responses to GCB:}


\textbf{Running Head: 43/45 characters}\\

The environment and evolution shape forests 


\textbf{What scientific question is addressed in this manuscript? 248 characters}\\
%emw7Oct2024 -- I think we need to be more exciting! And remember we can more here than we can in the paper (e.g., population)... here's one idea. 
%What determines budburst timing across species, sites and diverse forest communities in North America? While many models critical for future forecasts assume temperature and photoperiod explain forest leafout, we test the role of populations, species and community-level variation, including the role of evolutionary history in shaping species differences. 
%Climate change is shifting the timing of spring growth, making it critical we understand the drivers of variability in events like budburst. We tested how cues and evolutionary history relates to community-level budburst and across North America. 

% dlOct20: the box only allows 250 characters, so here is my paraphrasing of the above

While many models critical for future forecasts assume temperature and light explain forest leafout, we test the role of populations, species and community-level variation, including the role of evolutionary history in shaping species differences. 

\textbf{What is/are the key findings that answer this question? 246 characters}\\

Greater cues led to advances in budburst with some effects of evolutionary history, but little site-level variation. This suggests an incomplete understanding of budburst and that other unidentified traits or cues also shape phenology in forests.\\

\textbf{What are the novel results, ideas, or methods presented in work? 237 characters}\\
%emw7Oct2024 -- I think the fact that our model of budburst is massively incomplete should be the answer to the PREVIOUS question (and should sound much more exciting). Also, stick with evolutionary history here and don't try to mix in phylogenetic as a term if you can. For this question you can talk a little more about the vast scale of the study and your analytical approach. 
We are one of the first to mechanistically test the relationships and variability in budburst cues and evolutionary relationships at the community-level—with 47 tree and shrub species—and between four populations that span North America. 

\textbf{Describe how your paper fits within the scope of GCB, what biological AND global change aspects does it address. 249 characters}\\

%emw7Oct2024 -- I like the idea of pointing out here that results apply beyond forests and beyond plants, but this is ALSO your best chance to say why this matters -- carbon storage, forests etc. should be here as your opening finding. 
Our work offers novel insights into how shifts in budburst will impact future forest dynamics and carbon sequestration. This work also showcases an analytical approach that has broad applications across diverse species assemblages and phenologies.\\
